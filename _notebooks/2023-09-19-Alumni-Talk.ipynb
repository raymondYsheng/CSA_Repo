    "## Reflection\n",
    "I learned that it is important to decide, first and foremost, whether I want to do pure CS or if I want to do a coding related job. Additionally, I learned about the importance of internship and experience, since they really bolster a resume. Beyond this, I realized that personal projects that I build over time can really help my applications to both college and jobs, and it also grants me valuable skills and experience for me use in school and/or the workplace. The presentees also heavily stressed using Leetcode to prepare for interviews, since if you don't get 100% in an online interview there is no chance for getting a call back for future stages. Most of all, I need to create a personal website that shows my experiences, my interests, and flexes my skills in projects and coding. I also need to remember that showing that I am human is important to emphasize."
