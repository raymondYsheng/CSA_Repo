It included a self-made game loosely based on Space Invaders and an educational side that involved quizzing users with their knowledge of the universe as well as a leaderboard to keep track of quiz and game scores.\n",

We used external API methods as well as comparing sort times to visualize the time taken for various sort methods, while also providing valuable insight into the fluctuation of stock prices at the time.\n",

    "Nighthawk Resources was initially conceptualized as an alternative to the Stapplet program, a tool used in AP Statistics classrooms to allow students to visualize and work with data sets. However, throughout the course of the project it evolved to be an alternative to Canvas, a system used by Del Norte to track student classes, assignments, etc. The project includes fully functional account systems for teachers and students as well as systems for submitting and viewing student work. It also still includes the statistics features including systems to upload data sets through a picture and evaluate these data sets.\n",
